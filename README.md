# Program collection

This repository contains small programs from my research work. Instead of
creating many repositories I decided to collect all the programs here. They all
have their own version number that is automatically updated by a `pre-commit`
hook.

## Molecular simulation

### alkane_topology

Program to generate topology information (angles and dihedrals) for linear
alkane chains.
